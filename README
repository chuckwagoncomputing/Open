Open

 Open is a small ApplescriptObjC application for launching other apps with one
 click. It is good for saving Dock space.

How to Use

 Make .applescript files in Xcode (Note: Xcode 4 does not fully support 
 ApplescriptObjC, so use Xcode 3). Enter tell scripts to launch Apps.
 Add buttons in Interface Builder and connect them to the .applescript files.
 Build and Go.
